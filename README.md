# Flutter

Suppose a person develop a application for IOS devices and it becomes popular. Now he receives many requests from android users that he made a similar application for them also. So, for that firstly he have to learn java and kotlin, and after that he can make it. And he have to keep in mind all the screen resolution of the android mobile phones.

So, here comes the role of flutter, It is a toolkit that makes easy for developers to design beautiful interfaces. You don’t need to take tension about resolutions, and platforms because it automatically adjust its widgets according to the resolution the the mobile phones and you have to write code only in one language and the application will run in IOS devices, android devices and desktops as well.

- Fast development: Flutter offers a hot reload feature that allows you to see the changes in your app instantly without restarting the application.
- Beautiful and customizable UI: Flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets that enable developers to create stunning and visually appealing user interfaces
